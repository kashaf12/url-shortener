## Migration Notes

### v0.9.0 → v1.0.0 (Architecture Migration)

This major version represents a significant architectural shift from self-hosted Docker
infrastructure to managed services:

#### Database Migration

- **From**: Local PostgreSQL with Docker Compose
- **To**: Supabase managed PostgreSQL
- **Impact**: Improved reliability, automatic backups, zero maintenance
- **Migration Path**: Update environment variables, run Supabase setup

#### Deployment Migration

- **From**: Manual deployment processes
- **To**: Automatic CI/CD with Render (backend) + Vercel (frontend)
- **Impact**: Zero-downtime deployments, automatic scaling, monitoring
- **Migration Path**: Connect GitHub repositories, configure environment variables

#### Development Workflow

- **From**: `docker-compose up` for local development
- **To**: `pnpm supabase:start` for local development
- **Impact**: Faster setup, better local-production parity
- **Migration Path**: Install Supabase CLI, update development scripts

#### Documentation Updates

- All README files updated to reflect new architecture
- Environment configuration simplified with comprehensive templates
- Setup instructions updated for Supabase + managed services
- Production URLs added throughout documentation

---

## Security Updates

### Version 1.0.0

- Environment variable validation and secure handling
- Request correlation IDs for security audit trails
- Health check endpoints for monitoring and intrusion detection
- Input validation with Zod schemas across all API endpoints
- Prepared statements and parameterized queries for SQL injection prevention

---

## Performance Improvements

### Version 1.0.0

- Database indexing on slug and url+metadata for O(log n) lookups
- Connection pooling via Supabase for optimal database performance
- Edge deployment via Vercel for reduced latency
- Structured logging with Winston for performance monitoring
- Response time optimization with <100ms redirect targets

---

## Breaking Changes

### v0.9.0 → v1.0.0

#### Environment Variables

- `POSTGRES_*` variables replaced with Supabase configuration
- `DATABASE_PORT` changed from `5432` to `54322` for local development
- Added `SUPABASE_*` variables for managed database connection

#### Development Commands

- `docker-compose up` replaced with `pnpm supabase:start`
- `docker-compose down` replaced with `pnpm supabase:stop`
- Database migrations now use Supabase CLI instead of TypeORM migrations

#### API Endpoints

- Health check moved from `/api/healthz` to `/health`
- API documentation available at `/docs` instead of `/api/docs`
- All endpoints now use direct paths without `/api` prefix
