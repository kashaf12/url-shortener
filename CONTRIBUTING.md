# Contributing to URL Shortener

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! Any and all are welcome.

## How to Contribute

We'd love your help with:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kashaf12/url-shortener/issues). When you are
creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Explain the problem and include
additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or GitHub projects,
  or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the
  problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/kashaf12/url-shortener/issues).

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as
  possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include copy/pasteable snippets which you
  use in those examples.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull
requests:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

We use Prettier and ESLint to maintain a consistent code style. Please run `pnpm lint` before
committing your changes.

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Backend changes in `apps/backend/`
   - Frontend changes in `apps/frontend/`
   - Shared types in `packages/types/`

3. **Test your changes**:

   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pnpm test

   # Lint code
   pnpm lint

   # Type check
   pnpm type-check
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if needed

5. **Commit and push**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create pull request** via GitHub

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests** for new backend functionality
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- **Type safety** - all new code must be properly typed
- **Lint passing** - `pnpm lint` must pass
- **Build success** - `pnpm build` must complete without errors

- **New features** - Add value to the platform
- **Documentation** - Improve clarity and completeness
- **Performance improvements** - Optimize speed and efficiency
- **Security enhancements** - Strengthen platform security

### What We're Not Looking For

- **Breaking changes** without discussion

pnpm test:cov

# Run E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Writing Tests

- **Backend**: Create `.spec.ts` files alongside source code
