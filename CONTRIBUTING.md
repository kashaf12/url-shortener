### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

We use Prettier and ESLint to maintain a consistent code style. Please run `pnpm lint` before committing your changes.
